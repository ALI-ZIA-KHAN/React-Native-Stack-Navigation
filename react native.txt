For using Fonts

must to do this on app.js
import * as Font from 'expo-font';

downloaded google fonts family from which copied  fonts to asstes/fonts folder(we made fonts folder)

then this
const getFonts = () => Font.loadAsync({
  'nunito-regular': require('./assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf'),
  'nunito-bold': require('./assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf')
});


since its async and we dont want to things get rendered before fonts get loaded so
we used useState and if else to assured of getting fonts first then other stuff

in video initial state was false but in my case only true let stuff to be rendered tho its not write


this is the component of React Native on screen during loading
it fires get Fonts func during loaded as it gets done we chngd state

  <AppLoading

  startAsync={getFonts}
  onFinish={()=> setFontsLoaded(true)}
  />
